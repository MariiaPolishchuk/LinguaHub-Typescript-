        Research the Company: Before the interview, it's crucial to research the
        company thoroughly. Learn about its history, values, culture, products,
        services, and recent news. This knowledge will help you tailor your
        responses and demonstrate your genuine interest in the organization.
        Understand the Job Description: Carefully review the job description to
        understand the specific requirements and responsibilities. Prepare
        examples from your past experiences that align with the job
        requirements. Practice Interview Questions: Rehearse common interview
        questions, such as your strengths, weaknesses, accomplishments, and why
        you want the job. Practice your responses to ensure they are concise and
        relevant.
